### About me ###
<p>My&nbsp;goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;create convenient interfaces for users to&nbsp;make peopleâ€™s&nbsp;experience on&nbsp;the Internet easier and more enjoyable. I&nbsp;graduated from a&nbsp;publishing college, which means I&nbsp;can choose the appropriate font, arrange the elements on&nbsp;the page, and build a&nbsp;modular grid. I&nbsp;studied the basics of&nbsp;working with color, understood the principles of&nbsp;the Internet, networks, and browsers.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;also successfully completed The Rolling Scopes Training School JS/FE <nobr>Pre-School</nobr> 2022Q4 and gained knowledge and practical experience in&nbsp;creating web pages, working with Webpack and Node.js, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;solving JavaScript problems.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;am&nbsp;confident that enthusiasm, perseverance, the ability to&nbsp;read, understand, and clarify (if&nbsp;necessary) the requirements for the task will help me&nbsp;become a&nbsp;good frontend developer.</p>

### Code Example ###
'Bit Counting' on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/526571aae218b8ee490006f4/javascript).

> __Description:__ \
Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative. \
__Example:__ \
The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

__Solution:__

```javascript
var countBits = function(n) {
  n = (n).toString(2).toString(10).split('').map(int => parseInt(int, 10));
  return [...n].filter(el => el === 1).length;
};
```

[Plants](https://kozinaksa.github.io/jspreschool2022Q4/plants/) (study project). I needed to create a pixelperfect web page based on a layout from Figma, make it responsive and add functionality using JS. \
