### About me ###
My goal is to&nbsp;create convenient interfaces for&nbsp;users, to&nbsp;make people's stay on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Internet easier and&nbsp;more enjoyable. I&nbsp;graduated from&nbsp;a&nbsp;publishing college, which means I&nbsp;can&nbsp;choose the&nbsp;appropriate font, arrange the&nbsp;elements on&nbsp;the&nbsp;page, and build a&nbsp;modular grid. I&nbsp;independently studied the&nbsp;basics of&nbsp;working with color, Adobe PhotoShop and Illustrator. I&nbsp;understand the&nbsp;principles of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Internet, networks, browsers.

I&nbsp;also successfully completed The Rolling Scopes training School JS/FE <nobr>Pre-School</nobr> 2022Q4 and&nbsp;gained knowledge and&nbsp;practical experience in&nbsp;creating web&nbsp;pages, working with Webpack and Node.js as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;solving Javascript problems

I&nbsp;am&nbsp;sure that enthusiasm, perseverance, the&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;read, understand and clarify (if&nbsp;necessary) the&nbsp;requirements for&nbsp;the&nbsp;task, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;plan my working time will help me become a&nbsp;good frontend developer.

### Code Example ###
'Replace With Alphabet Position' on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/546f922b54af40e1e90001da/javascript).

> __Description:__ \
Welcome. In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet. \
If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it. "a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc. \
__Example:__ \
alphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.") \
Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )

__Solution:__

```javascript
function alphabetPosition(text) {
  let nums = [];
  const alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
  for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
    let symb = alphabet.indexOf(text[i].toLowerCase());
    if (symb !== -1) {
      nums.push(symb + 1);
    }
  }
  return nums.join(' ');
}
```
